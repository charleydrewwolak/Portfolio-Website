description: Sgraffito and Plique-Ã -Jour enameling techniques were used to make this broach inspired by Waldorf gnome lore - specifically a story of Puck the Gnome. Holding the broach up to the light reveals the glowing crystal that guided Puck on his journey through the depths of the earth. The broach is to be worn on the heart as a reminder to let your inner light guide you in your journey through life.
